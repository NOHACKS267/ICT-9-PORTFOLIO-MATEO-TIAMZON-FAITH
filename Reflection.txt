<p align="center" style="font-size:40px;"><b> In the 1st quarter of ICT-9, I had trouble remembering my past lessons because there was so much. And because of that, when lessons started, I was confused on many parts, but eventually
as more and more activites were given, I was able to somewhat keep up with them because I had remembered the past lessons and basics of HTML. I would say that the most difficult part of the quarter was memorizing all the different 
tags and attributes, and because I had difficulty in this, it resulted in poor performance in quizzes and hands-on outputs. But I promise to myself that this will change in the 2nd-4th Quarter, I have learned from my mistakes and
I will do everything I can to achieve a high grade in ICT and master the lessons. </b></p>
