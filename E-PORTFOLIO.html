<p align="right" style="font-size:35px;"<b> My name is Mateo S. Tiamzon, I was born on April 21, 2010, my hobbies are playing video games, and playing basketball, but I am not very good at it.
My goal in life right now is to finish school, but my long term goal is to retire my parents and build wealth for future generations. I am currently in 3rd year/ 9th Grade highschool and starting the 2nd quarter,
I hope I can do better in the 2nd quarter than in the 1st so I can reach my goals.
